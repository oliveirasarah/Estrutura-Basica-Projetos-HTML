# Basic Web Project Structure Automation with Python

> Python script for you to create basic **HTML, CSS and Javascript** projects easily

## Requirements

- Have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed in your computer
- See [here](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/) other ways to install it on Linux

## Walkthrough

When you click on `web_project.py`, your terminal/windows cmd will open and you'll be able to:

1. Choose the name of your project folder
2. Choose whether or not you want a separate `/js` folder
3. Choose whether or not you want a separate `/css` folder
4. Title of your HTML project (`<title></title>`)
5. Choose if you want to open your project with VS Code

Voil√†! Your project has been created, inside the project folder there'll be 3 files:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

If you choose to have separate folder for CSS and JS, it'll be like this:

- `index.html`
- `css/style.css`
- `js/script.js`

## HTML

The `index.html` comes with a basic structure and it's already linked to `style.css` and `script.js`.

## CSS

The `style.css` comes with these basic resets:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  border-box: border-box;
}
```
